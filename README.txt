Requirements:-
- python 3.x
- Tensorflow v1.x
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scipy
- PIL

Model:-
-The style Image has been genrated by minimizing the loss between the different
  layers of style,content and transferred images.
-The model that has been used to capture features is vgg16, trained on ImageNet 
  dataset.
